## Week 1
### A. Introduction
### B. Cultural Iceberg
#### Definition of Culture

Culture is made up of **explicit and implicit patterns**, these patterns come to us through historical influence and selected ideas. These patterns are expressed in institutions, practices, and artifacts.

Culture is the shared assumptions, values, and beliefs of a group of people which result in characteristic behaviors.

#### Visible & Invisible Dimensions

> ![[Cultural Iceberg.png]]

Implicit dimensions of culture **manifest** themselves in visible ways.

Behavior is the result of cultural values and beliefs.

## Week 2

### A. Universal, Cultural or Personal?

#### Review: What is Culture?

“Culture is made up of **explicit and implicit patterns**, these patterns come to us through **historical influence** and **selected ideas**. These patterns are expressed in institutions, practices, and artifacts.”

> *Historical Influence* is what makes cultures rooted -- you are shaped by culture!
>
> *Selection of ideas* is what makes culture **dynamic** -- you shape culture!

#### Universal Needs

Universal Needs: Needs all humans share, including both material and non-material needs. The former are for our physical life, and the latter psychological-spiritual-social life.

> Material needs: Food, water, shelter, clothing, physical touch, healthcare, sanitation, safety and security, energy, transportation, etc.
>
> Non-material needs: Love and connection, sense of belonging, respect and recognition, purpose and meaning, security and safety, etc.

#### Cultural Responses

Cultural Responses are ways humans respond to universal needs **filter through cultural patterns**. All actions, thoughts occur within patterns of culture.

#### Personal Choices

People still make choices about which parts of the cultural pattern they will accept or deny. These choices are what make cultures **dynamic**.

> Even if dumplings are popular in your hometown, it does NOT mean YOU like dumplings -- maybe you prefer a different dish!

![[Universal Cultural and Personal.jpg]]

### B. Beyond National Culture

Within a nation, there are also subcultures and regional cultures.

#### Mainstream Cultures

#### Subcultures

*Subculture*s are groups within the larger culture whose behavior, norms, and values often **differ in some distinct ways** from the overall mainstream culture. They can be groups defined by music, fashion, race, religion, leisure activities, etc. that is distinct from the mainstream culture.

> Examples of subcultures in the USA: Skater, Hindu, Chinese American.

What is the mainstream culture in one place may be a subculture in another.

Subcultures are **not limited to regional or national borders**.

> Category ideas: Youth subcultures, religious subcultures, ethnic subcultures, occupational subcultures, music subcultures, online subcultures, fashion subcultures, sports subcultures, tech subcultures, hobbyist subcultures, etc.
>
> Occupational Work Culture: Tech Workers
>
> - Explicit
>   - Work schedule and habits: long work hours
>   - Use of technology tools: cutting-edge tools
>   - Workplace environment: supporting long work hours
> - Implicit
>   - Work ethic and innovation: hard working and value innovative ideas

Subcultures influence our identities, values and behavior as well as our responses to universal needs. **Sometimes** they have more influence on a person than the mainstream culture.

#### Regional Differences

## Week 3

### Ethnocentrism

We often think the cultural responses that are more familiar to us are "best", "correct" or "superior", and that are unfamiliar to us are "strange", "incorrect" or "inferior".

*Ethnocentrism* is the evaluation of other cultures according to preconceptions originating in the standards and customs of one's own culture. It means that one may see his own culture as the correct way of living.

Avoiding ethnocentrism does not mean that one can never make judgements about another culture's behavior.

> Problems with never making any judgements ...
>
> - **Moral Problems**: It can make people think that any action is okay if it's part of another culture, even if it harms others.
> - **Universal Values**: It ignores important values, like honesty, fairness, respect for others, kindness, responsibility, etc. that should apply to everyone, regardless of the culture.
> - **Blocks Change**: It might stop people from fixing harmful traditions within a culture.

> Patriotism is when you love and support your country, you still respect other countries and their ways of life. It's about **pride in your own nation without thinking less of others**.
>
> *Ethnocentrism* is when you believe your culture is better than others. It often leads to **judging or looking down on people from different cultures**.

> Reasons why ethnocentrism can be harmful ...
>
> 1. There is a strong tendency to **compare and critique, mainly based on one's own cultures norms**.
>    - This can lead one to treat others with a **lack of respect**, which harms relationships.
> 2. It can **block learning**.
>    - This keeps one from learning new or different perspectives that could cause him to grow in helpful ways.

### Interpretation and Description

*Interpretation* is when you explain or give meaning to something based on your own thoughts, feelings or experiences.

> If you see someone frowning, you might interpret it as them being upset, even though they could just be thinking deeply.

*Description* is when you explain what you see, hear or experience without adding your own opinions or feelings. You just state the facts.

> If you see someone frowning, you describe it by saying, "the person has a frown on their face."

> Why do we usually interpret behavior?
>
> - Everyone has an *interpretive framework* that shapes how we see the world, which is sometimes called our *worldview*. It's like we are constantly wearing a pair of tinted cultural glasses.

### First Cultural Framework

Our 1st culture interpretive framework shapes how we see the world.

> Where does our 1st culture interpretive framework come from?
>
> - We are taught behavioral norms, which tell us what behaviors to copy and what to avoid.

Pros and cons: Our 1st culture interpretive framework **helps** us in our 1st cultural context, but **doesn't work well** in other cultural contexts.

*Jumping to conclusions* is when you quickly decide something **without having all the facts** or **without thinking carefully**. We should avoid *jumping to conclusions* because our interpretations may be wrong.

> If someone doesn't say hello to you, you might jump to the conclusion that they are angry with you, even though they might just be distracted or busy.

*Value judgments*: When we make the wrong conclusions about behavior, we can form the wrong impression about people's character.

See a behavior -> Make an interpretation -> Make a value judgement.

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Week 4

### A. Cultural Bifocals

*Cultural Bifocals* help us to see the world from multiple perspectives.

> A person with a single cultural framework is likely to be less effective than someone who can effectively use more than one cultural framework.

> The question is not "Who is right or who is wrong?" but rather, "How can we see the same so differently that i t results in not seeing **the same thing**" at all?

### B. Benefit of the Doubt & Cultural Orientations

#### Giving the Benefit of the Doubt

To see a culture *in it's own terms*: 

1. **Acknowledge and Reflect**
   - What is your initial reaction?
   - Where might your reaction be coming from?
2. **Imagine**
   - What are some other possible interpretations?
3. **Assume Positive Intent**
   - What might your neighbor / friend / coworker have been trying to communicate?
   - How "generous" is your current interpretation?
4. **Be Informed**
   - What are some general cultural practices in this context?
5. **Be Observant**
   - Are you paying attention to how people are acting in particular situations?

*Giving the benefit of the doubt*: the state of accepting something / someone as honest or deserving of trust even though there are doubts.

#### Cultural Orientation Scales

1. Cultural orientation scales are **generalizations**.
2. Cultural orientation scales are on a **gradient**.
3. Cultural orientation scales are **relative**.

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Week 5

### Generalizations

*Generalizations* involve categorizing members of the same group as having similar characteristics. They are a type of **hypothesis**, or **guess**, of what we expect to encounter when we interact with a certain culture.

Being aware of and understanding the patterns of the cultures to which one belongs (nation, age, gender, etc.) provides the basis for understanding other cultures and their sub- or co-cultures. Cultural generalizations can help us with this process.

Generalizations are a **necessary** part of intercultural communication as they can help us to anticipate, sort, and make sense of the new information and sensations we experience in intercultural situations.

Cultural generalizations can be used as a base to build upon, while we continue to seek out more information about individuals form other cultures.

However, cultural generalizations must not be applied to every person within a culture group.

### Stereotypes

Generalizations become stereotypes when all members of a group are categorized as having the same characteristics (***over**-generalization*).

Stereotypes can be linked to any type of cultural membership, such as nationality, religion, gender, race or age.

Stereotypes can, and often do, lead to prejudice and intentional or unintentional discrimination.

| Generalizations                                              | Stereotypes                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shows similarities between people but gives room for variety | Claiming people in a group are the same; saying what is true about one person in the group is true for everyone |
| More descriptive and objective                               | More **evaluative** and subjective; can be positive but **often negative** |
| Flexible                                                     | Inflexible                                                   |
| Open to adding new information                               | Resistant to adding new information                          |
| Starting point to understanding others                       | Barrier to understanding others                              |

>  The problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.

### Hedging Devices

The purpose of hedging is to ...

- **Avoid over-generalizations** (instead of saying *all, always, every time, everyone*)
- **Soften your claims when you aren't 100% certain** (instead of saying *this proves, this definitely shows, without a doubt*)
- **But still be able to demonstrate patterns and make some claims**

Other hedging devices:

| Modal Verbs | Adverbs of approximation | Distancing Verbs | Compound Hedges  |
| :---------: | :----------------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: |
|     Can     |        Apparently        |      Appear      | Seems reasonable |
|    Could    |          Likely          |     Indicate     |  Seems probable  |
|     May     |         Perhaps          |    Look like     |   Looks likely   |
|    Might    |         Possibly         |       Seem       |  Seems unlikely  |
|             |         Probably         |     Suggest      |                  |
|             |         Arguably         |     Tend to      |                  |
|             |        Reasonably        |      Imply       |                  |

Don't hedge too much!

## Week 7

### Individualism and Collectivism

**CONCEPT OF SELF**

|               Individualism               |                     Collectivism                      |
| :---------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
|      Individual is the smallest unit      |       Group (usu. family) is the smallest unit        |

to *pull one's own weight*: to work as hard as everyone else who is involved in the same task or activity.

*There is strength in numbers*.

In individualistic cultures, there is often emphasis on **self-reliance**, which is considered a **virtue**.

### Internal Diversity

There are two major contributors to internal diversity.

#### Regional Differences

#### Generational Differences

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Week 8

###  Value Trumping

*Precedence* refers to the condition of being considered more important than someone or something else, and therefore coming or being delt with first.

*Take precedence (over sth)*.

*Value trumping* is when one value is stronger or more important than others, or, in other words, when people **choose** to follow one value when there is a conflict between different values. Value trumping is the recognition that in **specific contexts**, certain sets of values take precedence over others.

### Task and Relationship Oriented Cultures

**PRIORITIZING**

|             Task Oriented              |         Relationship Oriented          |
| :------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: |
| Top Priority: getting down to business |  Top priority: building relationships  |
|      Emphasis on work to be done       |  Emphasis on people to get work done   |
| Important info is related to the task  | Important info is what supports people |
|  Success measured by tasks completed   | Success measured by people's reactions |
|     Small-talk cursory and limited     | Small-talk more personal and essential |

#### Building Trust

| Task Oriented                                                | Relationship Oriented                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| People **separate** personal and professional life.          | People **mix** personal and professional life.               |
| Personal connection isn't as important in professional relationships. | Personal relationships are important in professional settings. |
| Focusing on tasks and working efficiently shows professionalism and builds trust. | Investing in relationships and building a personal connection makes someone seem more trustworthy. |
| Trust is built on ***head trust*** or ***cognitive trust***, which is based on qualifications, work ethic, honesty and achievements. | Trust is build on both **qualifications** and **emotional connection**. |

### Monochronic and Polychronic

| Aspects                          | Monochronic                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Polychronic                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **View of Time**                 | Strict.<br>Time is extremely important and central to everything.<br>Time is measured in minutes, hours, days, etc., and people are very aware of how time passes.<br>Time is seen as limited and valuable. | Flexible.<br>Time revolves around people, tasks and events, not the clock.<br/>Time is flexible and can be stretched, molded or given freely.<br/>Time is seen as abundant and adaptable to situations. |
| **Scheduling**                   | Tasks are carefully scheduled into time slots to avoid wasting time.<br>People plan things far in advance and rarely change their plans.<br>Schedules are rarely flexible once set.                         | People focus on the present moment instead of strict future plans.<br>Plans are not made far in advance and are often changed easily to fit people's needs.                                             |
| **Task Completion**              | People prefer to focus on **one task at a time**, which is considered more efficient.                                                                                                                       | Tasks are still completed but often on a different timetable than originally planned.<br>People often do many things at the same time (*Multitasking*). Interruptions are normal.                       |
| **Relationships**                | To spend time with friends, you check your schedule and *fit* them *in*.                                                                                                                                    | Putting tasks or the clock above relationships seems unnatural.<br>Sticking too closely to a schedule could mean missing out on helping a friend or building relationships.                             |
| **Punctuality**                  | Punctuality is **highly** valued.                                                                                                                                                                           | Punctuality is valued.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Criteria for Showing Respect** | Punctuality shows respect.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Giving time shows respect.                                                                                                                                                                              |

**TIME ORIENTATION**

|             Monochronic             |                 Polychronic                 |
| :---------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
|    Time is limited *commodity*.     |    Time is bent to meet people's needs.     |
| Deadlines and schedules are sacred. | Deadlines and schedules are easily changed. |
|    Plans are not easily changed.    |              Plans are fluid.               |
| People may be too busy to see you.  |     People always have time to see you.     |
|   People live by external clock.    |       People live by internal clock.        |

Individualistic cultures tend to be more task oriented and more monochronic.

Collectivist cultures tend to be more relationship oriented and more polychronic.

## Week 9

### A. Idioms and Proverbs

#### Idioms on Time

> Time flies.
>
> > Time passes quickly. Used in contexts of surprise at how quickly time has gone by.
>
> Time is running out.
>
> > There is not much time left to finish something.
>
> Time is money.
>
> > Time is valuable, often used in work contexts to stress efficiency.
>
> Against the clock
>
> > Rushing to compete something within a limited timeframe.
>
> To kill time
>
> > To do something to pass the time when waiting.
>
> To waste time
>
> > To spend time on activities without purpose.

#### Idioms and Proverbs

Sayings in different languages can show us something about that culture's values.

*Idiom*s are different sayings or phrases that have a **special meaning**.

*Proverb*s are sayings about **wisdom**.

Idioms and Proverbs **reflect cultural values**.

> (Chinese saying) 计划没有变化快。Plans can't keep up with change.
>
> > It shows more of a polychronic and relational view of time.
>
> (Arabic saying) Some talk to you in their free time, and some free their time to talk to you.
>
> (Yiddish Proverb) Man plans and God laughs.
>
> (French Proverb) There's no sense in running. You just have to leave on time.

### B. Low and High Context Cultures

*Context* refers to the **background** or **situation** in which communication happens. It helps people understand the meaning behind what is being said.

#### Low Context Communication

Communication is "good" if it's **simple**, **clear**, **detailed** and **straightforward**.

People tend to repeat in writing to make things very clear and explicit.

#### High Context Communication

Communication is "good" if it's **nuanced**, **layered** and **subtle**, often involving **nonverbal cues**.

> *Nuanced* means something that has small, subtle differences or details. If something is nuanced, it's not just simple or straightforward; it includes layers of meaning or complexity.
>
> *Layered communication* means that a message has multiple levels of meaning, at least a surface level and a deeper level.
>
> *Subtle* means something that is not immediately obvious or easy to notice.

People's writing style tend to be indirect and polite and rely on shared understanding. Ideas aren't as clearly sequenced.



**ROLE OF CONTEXT**

|                         Low Context                          |                         High Context                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|                 In-groups are less developed                 |                 In-groups are well developed                 |
|   Fewer shared experiences (assume minimal shared context)   | More shared experiences (assume a high level of shared context) |
| Less shared understanding (do not assume people will understand them) |                  More shared understanding                   |
|            Being explicit is necessary and valued            |        Being explicit is unnecessary and less valued         |
|              Meaning is predominantly in words               |  Meaning is not always in words.(Messages are more subtle)   |
| Speaker is responsible to make sure the message is clearly communicated | Listener is responsible to pay attention to both the explicit and implicit meaning of a message |
| People often repeat ideas and clarify points to make sure the hearer understands |          Communication is often layered and nuanced          |

High context cultures usually have long history, established traditions, less migration and stronger group orientation.

## Week 10

### A. Peach and Coconut Cultures

#### Peachy People

- Friendly and open with strangers; willing to share about themselves
- Openly share stories about work, challenges or positive feedback at social gatherings.
- Information shared is not considered "private" but appropriate for casual conversation.
- Perception of openness:
  - Easy to get to know on a surface level, but deeper, personal matters are reserved for close friends or family.
  - Often leads others to feel a quick closeness, which may not reflect the actual relationship.
- Misunderstandings
  - People from more reserved cultures might misinterpret this openness as intimacy, and be surprised when they found that their "new close friend" does not pursue a deeper relationship.
  - Peachy people see casual small talk as non-intimate and public information, not as a sign of closeness.

#### Coconut People

- Appear distant, impersonal and guarded with strangers.
- Consider a wide range of information as "personal" and keep it private, especially with new people.
- Forming connections takes time, as they are protective of personal details.
- Building relationships:
  - Relationships require patience and trust to move from "outsider" to "insider".
  - Once trust is established, coconut people are open and loyal friends.
  - Friendships tend to be deep and long-lasting, unlike peachy cultures, where friendships may be more open yet changeable.

Cultural Differences:

- Coconut cultures emphasize a clear boundary between outsiders and insiders.
- Friendships in coconut cultures are often stronger and enduring than those in peachy cultures.

### B. Giving Supporting Evidence / Examples

Use evidence / examples to show connections when giving claims.

The pattern:

1. State your claim.
2. Give a piece of evidence that is connected to the claim.
3. Analyze the evidence to **explain** and show how it supports the claim.

| Step                                                         | Phrases                                                      |

### Direct and Indirect Styles of Handling Conflicts

**DEGREE OF DIRECTNESS**

|                     Direct                     |                   Indirect                    |
| :--------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------: |
|                Straightforward                 |                    Subtle                     |
|      Separates issues from relationships       |             Still confront people             |
|    Directness in conflicts is a **virtue**     | Might use a mediator (3rd party intervention) |
| Values honesty, efficiency and professionalism |             Values social harmony             |

To be *assertive*: to show a confident or forceful personality.

To *meet the issue head on*: to deal with something directly.

To *go straight to the root of the problem*.

To *confront* sb..

### Taboo Topics

A *taboo* is something that is not acceptable to say, mention or do. 

- It is banned because it is wrong or inappropriate.
- It could be a topic of conversation or a behavior.
- It could be legally banned or unacceptable by an unspoken rule.
- It may cause social trouble.
- It is talked about in a indirect way or only with those they know and trust.
  - Direct cultures may communicate in a much more indirect way about taboo topics.
  - Indirect cultures will also communicate in an even more indirect way than usual regarding taboo topics.

Common Taboo Topics:

- Religion
- Politics
- Money
- Sex
- Death

Taboo topics are not the same in every culture.

### Direct and Indirect Styles of Giving Negative Feedback

DEGREE OF DIRECTNESS

|              Direct               |                Indirect                |
| :-------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: |
|     People say what they mean     | People don't always say what they mean |
|     People mean what they say     | People don't always mean what they say |
| No need to read between the lines |     Have to read between the lines     |
|        Tell it like it is         |    Can't always tell it like it is     |
|    People say what they think     |        People suggest and imply        |
|           Yes means yes           |         Yes can mean maybe no          |

Low-context cultures are **typically** direct in communication. High-context cultures are typically indirect in communication.

### Cultural Paradox

*Cultural Paradox* shows that behavior in a culture can be opposite to what you might expect based on context or situation.

> Americans tend to be direct but may be indirect when giving negative feedback.
>
> Russians tend to be indirect communicators but can be very direct when giving negative feedback.

> Generalizations are helpful but sometimes the majority of people in a culture will behave differently from what would be expected in specific situations.

## Week 12

### Cultural Approaches to Conflict

**CONFRONTATION STYLE**

|              Ideas Confrontation              |           Relational Confrontation            |
| :-------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------: |
|    Disagreement with ideas stated directly    |      Disagreement with ideas more subtle      |
|  Assumption: only ideas are being challenged  |   Assumption: relationship must come first    |
|           Ideas are open for attack           |        Ideas are attached to feelings         |
| "It's just arguing. Don't take it personally" | "Be respectful of others' ideas and feelings" |

|                             | Ideas Confrontation                                          | Relational Confrontation                                     |
| :-------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|          **Focus**          | Disagreement is directed at ideas, not at the person.        | Disagreement is managed carefully to protect feelings and relationships. |
|         **Belief**          | Ideas and people are seen as separate; attacking an idea doesn't mean attacking a person's character. | Words can impact relationships, so people avoid direct confrontation to maintain harmony. |
| **Impact on Relationships** | Healthy conflict over ideas is seen as a sign of a strong relationship. | Confrontation can be perceived as personal criticism, which might harm relationships. |

### Saving Face

**IMPORTANCE OF FACE**

|              Less Important               |               More Important               |
| :---------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
|           Honesty is essential            |            Harmony is essential            |
|          Truth should be sought           |   Truth should be adjusted as necessary    |
| The Truth is more important than feelings | Feelings are more important than the truth |
|   "Face" is individuals' responsibility   |    "Face" is everyone's responsibility     |
|         Goal: getting/giving info         |    Goal: preserving/strengthening bonds    |
|       Have fewer ways to lose face        |        Have many ways to lose face         |

**Face matters in all cultures.** In some cultures, face strongly impacts behavior. In others, it has a smaller effect on actions and words.

### Hierarchical and Egalitarian Cultures

To *subject to criticism*: to be the recipient of outside criticism.

To *be one of the guys*: to be accepted by a social group; to act or be the same as the other members.

To *pull rank*: to take advantage of one's authority and seniority.

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Week 13

### A. Hierarchical and Egalitarian Cultures

#### Characteristics

*Hierarchy*: a system, especially in a society or an organization, in which people are organized into different levels of importance from highest to lowest; the group of people in control of a large organization or institution; a system that ideas or beliefs can be arranged into according to their importance.

*Low power distance* = egalitarian: 

- Boundaries surrounding what an individual within an organization "should" and "should not" do, and how they are treated, are less defined.
  - Role distinctions are a little less clear when looking on from the outside.
  - People maintain the appearance of equality.
  - How you treat someone "below" you in rank might not look that different than how you treat someone "above" you in rank, which is especially apparent in workplace environment.

*High power distance* = hierarchical

- The hierarchy is understood and adhered to, creating a sense of order.
  - Each person acts according to their role.
  - Each person is treated by others according to their role.
  - How you treat someone "below" you in rank might look dramatically different than how you treat someone "above" you in rank.

Egalitarian and hierarchical cultures represent different approaches to organizing and structuring societies or groups. **Neither approach inherently values individuals more or less**; they are simply different frameworks. Both cultures recognize the importance and value of individuals within their respective frameworks. Egalitarian cultures tend to value creating equal opportunities for individuals to contribute. In hierarchical cultures, individuals may be valued for their specific contributions within their roles.

| Key Features                            | Egalitarian                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Hierarchical                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Leadership Differences**              | Leaders often consult team members before deciding                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Leaders make decisions with less input from lower levels.                                                                                                                                   |



**POWER DISTANCE**

| Low power distance                  | High power distance                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Democratic management style         | Authoritarian management style     |
| Power usually shared                | Power is centralized               |
| Delegation to subordinates          | Not much delegation                |
| Subordinates dislike micro-managing | Subordinates wait for instructions |
| Initiative highly valued            | Initiative not necessary           |
| Consultative decision making        | Top-down decision making           |
| OK to disagree with boss            | No open disagreement with boss     |
| Boss-subordinate relations informal | Boss-subordinate relations formal  |
| Rank has few privileges             | Rank has many privileges           |

#### Giving and Receiving Honor

- **Collective honor**: In group-focused cultures, the boss's actions can affect the entire team's honor. The leader's actions reflect on the whole group.

### B. Universalism and Particularism

To *be hard on* sb.: to be critical or even to enact a punishment on sb., esp. if you have high standards for his behavior.

To *show sb. who's boss*: to demonstrate authority or dominance over sb. so that it is clearly recognized.

To *make an exception **for*** sb..

To *make an exception **to*** sth. (a rule, policy, etc.).

To *<u>assign weight to/place weight on</u>* sth.: to consider sth. important or give it significance.

To *have tolerance for* sth.

*On sb's behalf*.

To *sting*.

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Week 14

### A. Universalism and Particularism

*Dilemma*: a situation in which a difficult choice has to be made between two or more alternatives, esp. equally undesirable or satisfactory ones. The solution or right thing to do is unclear.

A *right* is something that people are allowed to have, do or say because it is considered **fair** or **just**.

**ADHERENCE TO RULES**

| Universalism                          | Particularism                          |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| What's right is always right          | What's right depends on circumstances  |
| There are absolutes                   | The are no absolutes                   |
| Rules are rules and cannot be broken  | Rules can be bent or broken            |
| There should be no exceptions         | There are always exceptions            |
| Consistency is important              | Consistency is not always best         |
| Fair means treating everyone the same | Fair means  treating everyone uniquely |

**Both logics are logical.**

- Particularists think universalists are corrupt because they won't even help their friends.
- Universalists think particularists are corrupt because you can't trust them to tell the truth.

In their best form, universalism and particularism are both striving for fairness. It would be absurd to call universalism "right" and particularism "wrong" or vice versa. The solution (to dilemma) lies not in universalism or particularism but in the integration of both because there are strong ethical principles to be found in both approaches.

|                 | Universalist Approach                                        | Particularist Approach                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Principle**   | Rules are fixed and apply equally to everyone, regardless of circumstances or relationships. | Rules are flexible and can be adjusted based on the situation and people involved. |
| **Logic**       | Fairness means treating everyone the same and applying the laws or standards equally. | Fairness is seen as understanding the unique context of each situation and the people involved. |
| **Application** | People **prioritize** standard **adherence to rules** over personal relationships, believing this approach maintains **objectivity** and **integrity**. | They **prioritize** the **relational impact** of their actions over standard adherence to rules, believing this upholds **loyalty** and **integrity**. |



*Pedestrian*: someone walking on the sidewalk

*Witness*: a person who has seen something happen with their own eyes, esp when they have seen a crime.

To *testify*: to give evidence in court when your are a witness.

*Integrity*: acting with strong moral principles.

### B. Culture Shock

#### Definition

*Culture <u>shock/fatigue</u>*: what happens whenever a person from one culture goes to another and needs to learn how to adapt to life there.

#### Stages

1. Honeymoon
2. Crisis
3. Recovery
4. Adjustment

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Week 15

### A. Culture Shock

#### Causes

1. Loss of control

   We are used to being in control of our surroundings. Moving to a new culture can make a person feel like they've lost control, which is uncomfortable.

2. Physical, mental and emotional fatigue

   These are 3 ways to spend and renew energy.

   - Physical: new home, change in physical activity, sleep, diet, etc.
   - Mental: language learning, history, culture, context.
   - Emotional
     - It's hard to feel dumb.
     - It's challenging to be far from family and friends, feeling lonely.
     - Learning is empowering and new friends are encouraging.

3. Loss of people, things and activities that refresh and re-energize.

4. Unfamiliarity of everything around them

### B. Using Multiple Lenses

Cultural Orientations

- Direct / Indirect
  - Handling Conflict
  - 'Negative Feedback
- Hierarchical / Egalitarian
- Universalism / Particularism
- Collectivism / Individualism
- Monochronic / Polychronic
- Task / Relationship Oriented
- High / Low Context

Make an ***educated guess***.
